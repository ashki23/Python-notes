# Complex numbers
Python supports computation with complex numbers. The imaginary unit is written as `j` in Python, 
instead of `i` as in mathematics. You can generate complex numbers by two following methods:
```python
a = 2j
print(a)
# 2j
b = complex(0,2)
print(b)
# 2j
c = 2+0.5j
print(c)
# 2+0.5j
d = complex(2,0.5)
print(d)
# 2+0.5j
